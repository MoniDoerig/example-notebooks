# example-notebooks

Each Jupyter notebook in the repository is equipped with two buttons at the top: a Binder button and a Google Colab button. These buttons will allow you to interact with the notebooks in a cloud-based environment. The environment is pre-configured to support Neurodesk, so you can start experimenting with the notebooks right away without having to install any additional software or packages.

2. Create a New Notebook: Make sure your notebook runs as expected. This includes sections for the introduction, data preparation, analysis, results.

3. Save and Submit: Once you're done, save your notebook and submit it for review. You can do this by creating a pull request on our GitHub repository.
